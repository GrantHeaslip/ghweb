This is a Django (Python 3.6+) project that will eventually host [my personal site](https://grant.heaslip.me), a server-side reimplementation of [my weather site](http://weather.grant.heaslip.me/), and future learning/side projects. It’s intended to run on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) via the [Waitress WSGI server](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/).

This project is essentially an excuse to learn Django and relearn Python. I’m open-sourcing it since someone might find parts of the code useful or instructive, but keep in mind that it’s My First Django Project, written by a front-end developer. A lot of this code is probably some combination of unpythonic, embarrassing, and dangerous, so make of it what you will!
