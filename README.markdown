This is an abandoned Django (Python 3.6+) project that was intended to host [my personal site](https://grant.heaslip.me) and serve as the basis for other personal sites. It was replaced by [this project](https://github.com/GrantHeaslip/website).

The site ran on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) via the [Waitress WSGI server](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/).

This project was essentially an excuse to learn Django and relearn Python. Iâ€™m keeping it available since it since someone might find parts of the code useful or instructive, but keep in mind that it was My First Django Project, written by a front-end developer. A lot of this code is probably some combination of unpythonic, embarrassing, and dangerous, so make of it what you will!
